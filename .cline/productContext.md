# Product Context: tts-mcp

## Problem Statement
Text-based AI assistants like Claude lack a natural speech output capability, limiting their usefulness in scenarios where users prefer or need audio communication. While these AI systems excel at generating text content, the absence of voice output requires users to read responses, which is not always convenient or accessible.

## User Needs
1. **Accessibility**: Users with visual impairments or reading difficulties need speech output to effectively interact with AI assistants.
2. **Multitasking**: Users want to listen to AI responses while performing other tasks that require visual attention.
3. **Natural Interaction**: Users desire a more human-like interaction experience with AI assistants through voice responses.
4. **Content Consumption**: Users want to convert long-form content (articles, documentation, stories) into audio for easier consumption.
5. **Integration**: Developers need a standardized way to add text-to-speech capabilities to their MCP-compatible applications.

## Solution Overview
tts-mcp addresses these needs through a dual-approach solution:

1. **CLI Tool**: A flexible command-line utility that converts text to speech with various customization options, ideal for:
   - Converting documents to audio files
   - Batch processing text content
   - Integration with scripts and automation workflows
   - Quick one-off text-to-speech conversions

2. **MCP Server**: A Model Context Protocol server that enables seamless integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients, allowing:
   - Real-time text-to-speech during AI interactions
   - Voice output triggered by conversational context
   - Consistent speech experience across compatible applications

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**: The MCP server should integrate naturally with Claude Desktop, requiring minimal configuration.
2. **Natural Speech**: The speech output should sound natural and pleasant to listen to.
3. **Customizability**: Users should be able to select voice characteristics that match their preferences.
4. **Reliability**: The system should handle a wide range of text inputs without errors or unexpected behavior.
5. **Responsiveness**: Speech generation should be fast enough to maintain the flow of conversation.

## Target Users
1. **AI Assistant Users**: Individuals who regularly use Claude and want voice output capability.
2. **Developers**: Those building applications with MCP integration who need to add speech capabilities.
3. **Content Creators**: People who want to convert written content to audio format.
4. **Accessibility Advocates**: Those working to make digital content more accessible through audio alternatives.
5. **Command-Line Power Users**: Technical users who prefer CLI tools for text processing workflows.

## Success Metrics
1. **Adoption Rate**: Number of users integrating tts-mcp with Claude Desktop.
2. **Usage Frequency**: How often the tool is used in conversations or for content conversion.
3. **Output Quality**: User satisfaction with the speech quality and naturalness.
4. **Integration Ease**: Time required for new users to set up and configure the system.
5. **Reliability**: Frequency of errors or failed conversions in regular usage.
