# Progress: tts-mcp

## Current Status
tts-mcp is a **fully functional** text-to-speech solution with two primary components:
1. A CLI utility for converting text to speech files
2. An MCP server for real-time text-to-speech integration with Claude Desktop

The project is in a **production-ready state** with all core features implemented and working properly.

- [x] Output to specified audio file
- [x] Configurable voice character selection
- [x] Configurable speech model selection
- [x] Configurable audio output format
- [x] Adjustable speech speed
- [x] Support for additional instructions to guide speech generation
- [x] Environment variable support for API key
- [x] Error handling with informative messages

### MCP Server ✅
- [x] Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
- [x] text-to-speech tool registration
- [x] **Descriptive metadata for tools and parameters**
- [x] Claude Desktop integration
- [x] Real-time speech playback
- [x] Temporary file management
- [x] Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- [x] Error handling with recovery mechanisms

### API Integration ✅
- [x] OpenAI API client integration

## Known Issues
- [ ] Potential path handling issues on Windows platforms
- [ ] No progress indicator during long TTS generations
- [ ] Limited feedback on API rate limiting or quota issues
- [ ] **Integration tests may hang when not properly terminated**
- [ ] **MCP client integration tests require proper environment setup**

## Testing Status
- [x] Unit tests: ~85% coverage for utils.ts
- [x] API tests: ~76% coverage for api.ts  
- [x] MCP server tests: ~40% coverage (improved from baseline)
- [x] **New integration tests for CLI functionality**
- [x] **New integration tests for MCP server startup**
- [x] **New integration tests for MCP client-server interactions**
- [ ] index.ts tests (still needed)

## Documentation Status
- [x] Installation instructions
- [x] Basic usage documentation
- [x] MCP server configuration guide
- [x] **Test documentation and execution guide**
- [x] **MCP tool and parameter descriptions in code**
- [ ] Advanced configuration documentation

## Future Work

### Short-term Improvements
- [x] **Improve MCP tool descriptions and metadata for better user experience**
- [ ] Add progress indicator for long-running conversions
- [ ] Improve Windows compatibility
- [x] **Enhance test coverage with integration tests**
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error codes and recovery suggestions
- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing**

### Feature Backlog
